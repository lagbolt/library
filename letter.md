## Letter to a New Library Director

This is an assortment (aka braindump) of some of my thinking over the past year or so regarding how to change public libraries for the benefit of patrons.

You should read this if you have (i) the ability, and (ii) the willingness to change.  The easiest way to verify this is if you have already changed something -- anything -- at your library.

### Literature Review

(Or, what I have read recently)

In 2016, Rachel Clarke wrote a PhD thesis called "Itâ€™s Not ~~Rocket~~ Library Science:  Design Epistemology and American Librarianship".  It's great, it won several awards, but some of it is quite dense.

In 2020, Clarke wrote a book called "Design Thinking" which summarized the less theoretical parts of her thesis (e.g., no epistemology).  I'm certainly not the person to comment on the thesis, although I do as a practical matter it's helpful.  Here's Clarke's design epistemology in two sentences:  Don't delay change until you know exactly what will happen.  You'll find out as you go along.

I actually read the book first (ALA had a half-off sale!), then the thesis, then the book again.  I generally agree with the book.  I would have emphasized some things more, but that falls into the category of commenting on the book I would have written, rather than responsing fairly to Clarke's book.

Clarke does an excellent job discussing the role of trial and error in design and change, using the same three examples that she presents in more detail in her thesis.  It makes no sense to propose "Allow yourself to risk failure!" as an abstract rule if you're not actuall going to show a sequence of failures with gradually improving results.

Clarke also mentions the role of empathy in user (i.e., patrpn) focus.  Perhaps I would have been clearer that empathy with the patron means identifying and addressing their feelings -- possibly quite irrational -- rather than working towards satisfying their stated or unstated needs.

Finally, Clarke points out that a patron walks into the library -- or goes to the online catalog -- in the middle of things.  They're already worried about making dinner or getting the car fixed before they ever decide to look for a book or movie.

One of the good things about reading books and articles by librarians is that the references are always extensive and often quite helpful.  I tracked down [Edward Luca and Bhuva Narayan's Signage by Design](https://doi.org/10.3998/weave.12535642.0001.501) and it's an excellent supplement to Clarke's examples of trial and error.  I always find signage fun to read about because the "before" examples are so terrifyingly bad.

Clarke also references her work with Sayward Schoonmaker (Rachel Ivy Clarke, Sayward Schoonmaker, The Critical Catalog: Library Information Systems, Tricksterism, and Social Justice, CHI '20: Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems April 2020, pp1-13) which provides a nice example of the constraints involved in trying to improve the catalog.

### Library Anxiety

[Library Anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_anxiety) was named by Constance Mellon in 1986.  I think it's important to keep in mind when discussing the need for empathy.

This doesn't necessarily involve overwhelming emotions -- just enough of a bump to make a trip to the supermarket to pick up zucchini feel more urgent than a trip to the library.  Here's a personal example ...

A few days ago I was in the library picking up an inter-library loan for myself and a hold for my wife.  I also took a paperback from the science fiction paperback rack.  Our library has fabulous self-checkout machines which will read the RFID tags from a pile of books all at once, but when I piled the books on the machine, it didn't pick up the paperback.  After fiddling with it for a while I gave up and went over to customer service, where the staff member was happy to check out the book for me.  Which is when I remembered that paperbacks don't have RFID tags and you have to scan the bar code on the checkout machine.

The library would have counted this as a success for circulation (another book borrowed!) and a success for customer service (another patron helped!) but I felt a bit foolish.  That's "library anxiety"!

It's also an example of the confusion between success and failure.  Of course I'm not suggesting that helping a patron is a failure, but sometimes it  can be diagnostic of failures in other areas.  For example, if it's really true that people often ask the reference desk where the bathrooms are, perhaps you need better signage?

Which is a perfect segue to ...

### Wayfinding

Why is this such a problem?  I think that part of the problem is that the people who put up signs in a public library have been working there for decades.  Where do you put the sign for biographies?  Well, you put it where the biographies are shelved.
