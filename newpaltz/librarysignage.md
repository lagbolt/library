## A Visit to the SUNY New Paltz Library

This note collects my comments on some of the signage I found at the SUNY New Paltz Sojourner Truth Library when I visited on September 12 and 13, 2022.

I also include some context on why library signage is important and references to other writing I have done on signage.

### Theoretical Context

My thoughts on signage are grounded in two concepts.  The first is "library anxiety", which is mentioned below.

The second is in drawing a bright line between interactive services (i.e., involving a librarian) and non-interactive services (the patron alone).  I believe that non-interactive services should be as easy and useful as interactive services.  This means that "If you need help, ask a librarian" is not a universal remedy for weaknesses in service design, including signage, since some patrons may not want to "ask a librarian".

I've written about the importance of non-interactive services in [Technical Services: The Next Three Years](https://github.com/lagbolt/library/blob/main/TechServices.md), but I should warn you that it's overlong and a bit of a rant.

### Library Anxiety

[Library Anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_anxiety) was named by Constance Mellon in 1986.  She found that most students are fearful when approaching the library.  Of course this has effects much wider than signage, but I think it's important to emphasize the signage should not be evaluated in terms of the ideal, thoughtful student, but in terms of one who is anxious about an encounter with the library.

### The Book

Mark Aaron Polger has written a book about library signage, *Library Signage and Wayfinding Design*.  You don't have to read the whole thing, since he has summarized it in an article he wrote for American Libraries Magazine.  Here's [the article](https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2022/09/01/show-and-tell/).

Polger approaches wayfinding and signage systematically.  For example, he rightly puts "research your audience" as the first step in improving signage.  At the same time, I think this overstates what you need to do to make *some* improvements in signage.  My response to Polger's book can be found [here](https://github.com/lagbolt/library/blob/main/Polgerbookreview.md).

### At the Sojourner Truth Library

This is just inside the entrance to the library:

(You can embiggen the images in this note by right-clicking and choosing "open image in new tab".)

The building directory is invisible on the left.  The librarians are invisible on the right.  The switched-off monitor at the upper right makes this area feel a bit abandoned.  This isn't necessarily a problem for a confident student, but remember that most students aren't.

Here's the building directory:

<img src="images\librarydirectory.jpg" alt="A sign listing what's on each floor of the library.  There's a small 'You are here' indication at the top." height="300" />

The first time I visited the library, I missed this sign completely.  The second time, I missed the small 'You are here' indication.  And the sign doesn't seem to be complete.  The reference section is on the main floor, but it's not mentioned. Is this the *only* sign which describes what is where?  What about a QR code which links to an online map?

Here's a photo from inside the reference section:

<img src="images\shelfendinreference.jpg" alt="Two library shelves with multiple small signs high up on each end." height="300" />

These signs look as though they haven't been changed since about MCMLXVIII.  First, why are these signs so high up on the shelf end and not at eye level?  That just makes it harder for someone in a wheelchair.  Second, the print on the middle signs — which show the call number range for the shelves — is far too small.  Is it ADA compliant?  Third, the signs need some serious graphic design help.  Why doesn't the sign with the shelf number —  the one piece of text large enough to read —  identify the shelf as part of the reference section.  "REF 15" is a whole lot more informative than "15".  Why are there three signs for each shelf?  Why are they all black text on white?
                                                                                                             
Last, here's a printer sign:

<img src="images\printersign.jpg" alt="The text 'PRINTER 1' printed on a building column next to a printer and some desks" height="300" />

I have so many questions!  Can you print to this printer from any computer, or just the ones nearby?  Is printing free?  If not, how much does it cost?  Can I print from my phone?  Can I print from a USB stick?  Can I email the printer?  Can it print in color or just black and white?  If black and white, is there another printer in the library which will print in color?  I'm certainly not the one to design your signage, but one approach would be to include a QR code which links to online documentation.  And no, "if you have questions, ask a librarian" is not an answer.

### Conclusion

The goal of signage design is not, "Does this sign look OK?".  The goal should be, "Is this sign the best it can be?".  And also, "Are the existing signs helping the patrons as much as possible?".  Since that will change over time, you have to review signage regularly.  As a small example, QR codes were not a thing five years ago, and now they are becoming ubiquitous.  I don't know whether QR codes would be familiar and reassuring to an anxious student, or just another source of anxiety, but that's certainly something you can find out.
