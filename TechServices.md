## Technical Services:  The Next Three Years

This is my input to:

   * The Frederick County Public Library 2023-2025 Three Year Plan, and
   * An effort in an unnamed Virginia public library to "update and reinvigorate Technical Services"

It's a coincidence that these two things happened to drop at the same time.  I'll be talking mostly about Technical Services, depending on where you draw the line.  For example, I'll discuss the web site, and signage.

#### The Disclaimer

What follows is just what I've been thinking about lately.  I couldn't hope to be able to specifically identify the top two or three things that will drive change in technical services.

### Context

You can't do more with less.  In fact, you probably can't do what you think you're doing with the resources you think you're allocating to technical services.  (In case it's not absolutely clear, "you" means a public library).  You can only do more with more.

Library workers need to be unionized.  This could help with a number of problems, including vocational awe, precarity, and various kinds of bias.

### The Button

More than a tag line, every campaign needs a button.  I suggest two:

   * It takes a Library
   * Together We Can

One of the themes I want to emphasize is that Technical Services should be involved in all, or perhaps most, library services.  I have no particular brief against organizational silos; nevertheless, sometimes silos should work together.  The whole library organization should be working together.  Of the two buttons, I like the second a bit better than the first since it brings in the community as well as the library — as long as you remember that different parts of the library should work "together".

## Service Modes

* Digital

A patron goes to the web site or catalog and obtains information or borrows e-media.

[I'm not really sure whether the web site should count as part of Technical Services, so unfortunately sometimes in this note I treat it as separate and sometimes not.]

* Interactive

A patron goes to the library and interacts with a librarian to obtain information, borrow an item, attend an event (e.g., story hour) or use a library facility (e.g., 3d printing).

* Non-interactive

A patron goes to the library and obtains information or borrows an item without interacting with a librarian.  Here's where I'll have something to say about signage.

* Independent

A patron attends an event at the library without interacting with a librarian

* Marketing

Information provided by the library in a tweet, email newsletter or a display in the library.

Obviously, the boundaries between these modes are not absolute.  For example, a patron might borrow a book and have a librarian check the book out.  Or a patron might see an event listed on the web site and then later attend the event.

The goal is to make service equally easy and effective in each mode.  I want to be clear that "If you have a question, ask a librarian" is not an easy or effective solution for Digital or Non-Interactive modes.  I'll expand on my reasoning below.

I want to use this framework to discuss Technical Services from three angles:

* How Technical Services can enhance other library functions

* How other library functions can enhance Technical Services

* How Technical Services can improve its own operation

## Technical Services Adding Value to Other Services

If the catalog HAS value, it will ADD value whenever the collection is relevant to another library activity.  The activity doesn't even need to be book related.  If a local potter is doing a pottery demonstration, the promotional materials could include a QR code to search the catalog for materials on pottery.

#### A Silly Example

Suppose a public library is going to celebrate National Crocodile Day.  There will be a display of crocodile books as you enter the library, crocodile puppets in the children's section and a talk about crocodiles by a local author, all of which will be heavily promoted on social media, including in the library email newsletter and on the library's Twitter, Facebook and Instagram feeds.  If the OPAC supports it, a librarian will create a list of crocodile books which will also appear in the library's social media feeds.

The problem is this barely touches the collection and the catalog at all.  How should technical services be involved in National Crocodile Day?

If a librarian tweets a book recommendation, why doesn't that tweet include a link to the catalog?  If a librarian goes to the trouble of compiling a list of 10 or 20 crocodile books, why doesn't that list end with a canned OPAC search for more crocodile books or movies.

Let's abandon crocodiles and see what we can do during  Gay Pride Month (which happens to be June).  I'll use the service mode framework I defined above.

#### Digital Service Mode

Suppose you build a landing page for Gay Pride Month on the web site.  (It could be fcpl.org/gaypride, for example.)  What should be on the landing page?

-- lists or searches, that is the question!

Do you give someone a fish or teach them to fish?  Or you could give someone a fish and offer to teach them to fish.

BiblioCommons has an interesting feature where you can interpolate other information between results on the search results page.  If someone searches for any of the terms in LGBTQIA+, the search results page could include a pointer to the Gay Pride landing page.  This would be useful year round, and not just for a month.  Of course in this, as in so many other things, you're at the mercy of your OPAC vendor.



## Other Services Adding Value to Technical Services

Let me start off with a *reductio ad absurdum*:  Libraries put a lot of effort into informing patrons about different library services and events, and none into how to use advanced search.  What would it look like if the entire library decided to help people search the catalog?

-- reference desk would display searches
-- marketing materials would include sample searches

-- in-library displays would include searches or a QR code



#### Digital Service Mode



A tweet or FB post could explain how to do Boolean searches, using as an example a search on ...

## Improvements within Technical Services

Here I want to discuss a few different areas that maybe aren't all Technical Services:

 * The organization of the web site
 * Wayfinding and Signage
 * Searching the catalog
 * Catalog correctness and completeness

### The Organization of the Web Site


### Wayfinding and Signage

### Searching the catalog

-- the web site would pop-up links to tutorials

Some libraries have implemented a search page that is separate from the catalog and sits in front of it.

For example, the [Tulsa City-County Library](https://www.tulsalibrary.org/) has a search box on their front page which returns results on a custom results page.  It's easier to see than it is to describe, so click on the link and search for "computer".  You'll see results from the catalog, the web site, and the events calendar.  You can get to the full catalog by clicking on "SEE ALL RESULTS IN CATALOG", or you can do another search in this simplified environment.

Although Tulsa Library doesn't do it, the custom search results page could include links to help on searching.

It's obviously some work to implement custom searching with a custom results page, but the advantage is that you've escaped the limitations of your OPAC.

### Enhancing the Catalog

Almost anything you do in this area, other than paying a third party to do it, is going to involve a combination of automatic and manual checking.

#### Quality Control

I can think of two ways of doing quality control of the catalog data, and one that doesn't work very well.

The one that doesn't work very well is to check catalog records for internal consistency.  For example, you could check that if a catalog record has an 830 field, it also has a 490 field.  The problem is, this sort of technical error won't make any difference to patrons (although I suppose this example depends on how you have your OPAC configured) and errors that do make a difference won't be picked up by this sort of check.

One way that works pretty well — one I've used a few times in a couple of different ways — is to check catalog records against an external reference.
 * subjects and names against the LoC authority files
 * series information (or the lack of it) against GoodReads
 [Note:  Goodreads series data is far more complete than Novelist, and I have the data to prove it.]

 #### Typos

Any typo can potentially affect keyword searching, but typos in subject headings are particularly bad, since the result is that an item disappears from search results.

For example, there are 8 books and a DVD with a subject heading of "supsense" in the FCPL catalog.

Typos aren't actually very common.  I collected data for a handful of typos from 100+ public libraries in the US and for any given typo the median number of times it occurred was zero.

#### Offensive Subject Headings

For example, a search of the FCPL catalog returns 675 items with the subject heading "Indians of North America".



 Another possibility, which I'd describe as more of a research project because I haven't tried it yet, is to look at your search logs and check the results.  The advantage of this approach is that it fixes what is actually relevant to patrons.

SCRAPS

Tweeted April 16:
Just a reminder that all FCPL locations will be closed tomorrow, Sunday, April 17, in observance of Easter.

I just can't express how angry this makes me.

V. E. Schwab has two NARs.  Andrea Stewart has one but it's not the LoC value.

What about tweeting a reference to maryland.overdrive.com?
