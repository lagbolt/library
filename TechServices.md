## Technical Services:  The Next Three Years

This is my input to:

   * The Frederick County Public Libraries (FCPL) 2023-2025 Three Year Plan, and
   * An effort in an unnamed Virginia public library to "update and reinvigorate Technical Services"

It's a coincidence that these two things happened to drop at the same time.  I'm able to address then both at the same time because my interest and focus in public libraries is in Technical Services.  To be honest, I'm not sure what is Technical Services and what is not.  I'll be looking at:

   * the online catalog
   * the web site
   * wayfinding and signage

When I need to refer to these three things in a bucket, I'll call the bucket "Non-interactive services", meaning services that don't entail interacting in person with a librarian.

#### The Disclaimer

What follows is just what I've been thinking about lately.  I couldn't hope to be able to specifically identify the top two or three things that will drive change in technical services.

#### Context

You can't do more with less.  In fact, you probably can't do what you think you're doing with the resources you think you're allocating to technical services.  (In case it's not absolutely clear, "you" means a public library).  You can only do more with more.

Library workers need to be unionized.  This could help with a number of problems, including vocational awe, precarity, and various kinds of bias.

### The Button

There are three threads running through this note:

   * different organizations within the library should work together
   * the quality and ease of service a patron experiences shouldn't depend on whether they interact in person with a librarian; it shouldn't depend on whether they're visiting the building or the web site
   * patrons should be educated in using library resources

This last comes down to teaching patrons to fish *in addition to* giving them fish.

More than a tag line, every campaign needs a button.  I suggest two:

   * It takes a Library
   * Together We Can

I like the second a bit better than the first since it brings in the community as well as the library — as long as you remember that different parts of the library should "work together" as well as the library and the community.

## All services are services

I want to be very clear that Non-interactive Services, Technical Services, *are* services.  Let's look at some ways patrons use the library:

* A patron goes to the web site or catalog and borrows e-media;

* A patron goes to the library and borrows an item without interacting with a librarian;

* A patron attends a non-library event at the library;

* A patron sees a tweet or email message or display in the library and adds a new book to their TBR list;

* Based on something a friend says, a patron checks the catalog and discovers a new book by a favorite author.

If you regard non-interactive services as no less than interactive services — and I do — you have to treat non-interactive services as self-sufficient.  "If you have a question, ask a librarian" undercuts that commitment by turning a non-interactive service into an interactive service.  This has obvious implications for, e.g., online documentation or signage.

## How Services Relate to Each Other

Here's a brain dump, or a mind map if you're inclined to be charitable:

<img src="images\TS-Mindmap.jpg" alt="Diagram showing how library programs relate to non-interactive services, including the web site and catalog" height="300" />

I'm going to talk about the elements in the upper left of the diagram before we jump into the deep end of the catalog.

## The Web Site





### Landing Pages

In "landing pages" I include true landing pages like [Bulding Bridges](https://fcpl.org/building-bridges) as well as child pages like [Building Bridges Adult Titles](https://fcpl.org/building-bridges-adult-titles).  Let's look at the latter.

There are 40 books on this page.  It's a pretty good list, but the library probably has thousands of similar books.  For example, the list includes three cookbooks.  By clicking to each cookbook and clicking on subject headings, I found 27 African American, 22 African, 35 Chinese and 5 Philippine cookbooks.

### Online Documentation



-- gap --

Suppose you build a landing page for Gay Pride Month on the web site.  (It could be fcpl.org/gaypride, for example.)  What should be on the landing page?

There are lots of examples of landing pages on the current web site.  For example, 

-- lists or searches, that is the question!

***Following is out of place***

BiblioCommons [4] has an interesting feature where you can interpolate other information between results on the search results page.  If someone searches for any of the terms in LGBTQIA+, the search results page could include a pointer to the Gay Pride landing page.  This would be useful year round, and not just for a month.  Of course in this, as in so many other things, you're at the mercy of your OPAC vendor.


## Wayfinding and Signage

Mark Aaron Polger was written a book on signage called *Library Signage and Wayfinding Design* which you can [buy from ALA](https://www.alastore.ala.org/wayfinding).

My general comments on signage, and specific comments on the book, [can be found here](https://github.com/lagbolt/library/blob/main/Polgerbookreview.md).

I've reviewed the wayfinding and signage at a number of branches of the Las Vegas Clark County Library District.  My review [can be found here](https://github.com/lagbolt/library/blob/main/LVCCLD-signage.md)

I'm going to show a couple of examples from the Frederick County Public Libraries system, specifically the central, C. Burr Artz branch.  I'm shpwing these examples because I happened upon them, not because either the branch or the system is deficient in some way.

The shelving upstairs in the library is laid out sensibly, and the signage is clear.  The signs are color-coded:  one color for fiction and one for non-fiction.  And then there's this sign:

<img src="images\ArtzEndcapSign.jpg" alt="Photo of a sign on the end of a library shelf, explained in the text" height="300" />

One side of this shelf holds the beginning (AA-BA) of the fiction section.  The other side of the shelf holds Large Print Biography, Large Print Non-Fiction, and the end (SZ??) of the Large Print Fiction section.

The person who wrote this sign tried to get all this information into a sign that's exactly the same size as all the other signs.  It's too much!

Most of the shelves are perpendicular to the main aisle, so the signs on the ends of the shelves are quite visible.  The Science Fiction shelves are against the wall on the right, parallel to the aisle.  Here's one of the signs for Science Fiction:

<img src="images\ArtzScienceFictionSign.jpg" alt="Photo of a sign on the end of a library shelf, explained in the text" height="300" />

Can you see the sign?  Nor can I.  Let's zoom in:

<img src="images\ArtzScienceFictionZoomed.jpg" alt="Photo of a sign on the end of a library shelf, explained in the text" height="300" />

The problem is that this sign, like all the others, has been placed on the end of the shelf.  There's *almost* nowhere along the central aisle where this sign is readable.

What's missing is a sign at what Polger calls a "bump point".  A place where the patron has to be bumped in the right direction.

## The Catalog

What use is the catalog?

If the catalog HAS value, it will ADD value whenever the collection is relevant to another library activity.  The activity doesn't even need to be book related.  If a local potter is doing a pottery demonstration, the promotional materials could include a QR code to search the catalog for materials on pottery.

### Marketing the Catalog

Let me start off with a *reductio ad absurdum*:  Libraries put a lot of effort into informing patrons about different library services and events, and none into how to use advanced search.  What would it look like if the entire library decided to help people search the catalog?

Suppose a public library is going to celebrate National Crocodile Day.  There will be a display of crocodile books as you enter the library, crocodile puppets in the children's section and a talk about crocodiles by a local author, all of which will be heavily promoted on social media, including in the library email newsletter and on the library's Twitter, Facebook and Instagram feeds.  If the OPAC supports it, a librarian will create a list of crocodile books which will also appear in the library's social media feeds.

The problem is this barely touches the collection and the catalog at all.  How should technical services be involved in National Crocodile Day?

If a librarian tweets a book recommendation, why doesn't that tweet include a link to the catalog?  If a librarian goes to the trouble of compiling a list of 10 or 20 crocodile books, why doesn't that list end with a canned OPAC search for more crocodile books or movies.

Let's abandon crocodiles and see what we can do during  Gay Pride Month (which happens to be June).

#### Social Media

A tweet or FB post could explain how to do Boolean searches, using as an example a search on ...

#### Readers Advisory

-- reference desk would display searches
-- marketing materials would include sample searches

-- in-library displays would include searches or a QR code

### Searching the catalog

-- the web site would pop-up links to tutorials

Some libraries have implemented a search page that is separate from the catalog and sits in front of it.

For example, the [Tulsa City-County Library](https://www.tulsalibrary.org/) has a search box on their front page which returns results on a custom results page.  It's easier to see than it is to describe, so click on the link and search for "computer".  You'll see results from the catalog, the web site, and the events calendar.  You can get to the full catalog by clicking on "SEE ALL RESULTS IN CATALOG", or you can do another search in this simplified environment.

Although Tulsa Library doesn't do it, the custom search results page could include links to help on searching.

It's obviously some work to implement custom searching with a custom results page, but the advantage is that you've escaped the limitations of your OPAC.

### Enhancing the Catalog

Almost anything you do in this area, other than paying a third party to do it, is going to involve a combination of automatic and manual checking.  There is no magic bullet.

One reason to be concerned with the catalog is that errors and omissions in the catalog mean that patrons will see incorrect results from a search.

In 2005, Jeffrey Beall wrote a column for the ALA's American Libraries magazine giving "Ten Ways to Improve Data Quality" [1].  The reason I'm mentioning this here is that his tenth point was that everyone in the library should be involved in finding catalog errors.  This is part of what elevates catalog quality from a sticky note to a part of strategy.

#### Catalog Quality

I've written about catalog quality for Technicalities [3].  That article has several interesting examples of data I've collected from the LVCCLD (Las Vegas) catalog.

I'm interested in three different, separate three standards for catalog quality:

1. Assessing catalog records against a standard, either internal or external
2. Effectiveness in supporting library programs
3. Effectiveness in supporting the community

#### Is this a big problem?

Well, that's a good place to start!  How many of your catalog records have errors?

 [Note:  Goodreads series data is far more complete than Novelist, and I have the data to prove it.]

 #### Typos

Any typo can potentially affect keyword searching, but typos in subject headings are particularly bad, since the result is that an item disappears from search results.

For example, there are 8 books and a DVD with a subject heading of "supsense" in the FCPL catalog.

Typos aren't actually very common.  I collected data for a handful of typos from 100+ public libraries in the US and for any given typo the median number of times it occurred was zero.

#### Offensive Subject Headings

For example, a search of the FCPL catalog returns 675 items with the subject heading "Indians of North America".

OCLC has just issued a report on this topic, *Reimagine Descriptive Workflows* [3].  It's worth reading the whole thing, but I want to pull a few sentences out of the report.

The report clearly advocates adding subject headings from alternative (i.e., non-LCSH) controlled vocabularies.  It gives an example of a record from the State Library of New South Wales which includes First Nations subject headings [3, p21].

Talking about the tension between local variation and network standardization, the report states, "It is likely that future systems will need to accommodate elements
of both." [3, p13].  To me, this is a  rejection of Library of Congress control in reaction to the time taken to respond to the "illegal aliens" heading.  Something other than the Library of Congress change process is clearly needed.

The question of power and control is central to any discussion of alternative subject headings, and the OCLC report spends a significant fraction of the report considering it.  As a patron and not a librarian, I'm comfortable with the idea that patrons could select subject headings, but I understand that professional librarians might not be so sanguine.

==========================================

SCRAPS

Another possibility, which I'd describe as more of a research project because I haven't tried it yet, is to look at your search logs and check the results.  The advantage of this approach is that it fixes what is actually relevant to patrons.

## Notes

[1] Beall, Jeffrey, 10 Ways to Improve Data Quality, American Libraries, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Mar., 2005), pp. 36-37

Here's the tenth entry:  "**Involve all library staff in database maintenance.**  Have staffers report errors to a central person, preferably someone in the cataloging department.  Many library staff make extensive use of the library catalog and are in a position to observe errors.  Take advantage of their catalog use and ask them to report the errors they find.

"Library catalogs should be tools for research; we must not allow them to become barriers to retrieval.  Libraries are obligated to to make services as error-free as possible.  A coordinated effort to eliminate errors in online catalogs demonstrates a strong commitment to quality service.  The reward of this work will be better access to library materials for our patrons."
