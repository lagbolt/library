## Technical Services:  The Next Three Years

This is my input to:

   * The Frederick County Public Libraries (FCPL) 2023-2025 Three Year Plan, and
   * An effort in an unnamed Virginia public library to "update and reinvigorate Technical Services"

It's a coincidence that these two things happened to drop at the same time.  I'm able to address them both at the same time because my interest and focus in public libraries is in Technical Services.  To be honest, I'm not sure what is Technical Services and what is not.  I'll be looking at:

   * the online catalog
   * the web site
   * wayfinding and signage

When I need to refer to these three things in a bucket, I'll call the bucket "Non-interactive services", meaning services that don't entail interacting in person with a librarian.

#### The Disclaimer

What follows is just what I've been thinking about lately.  I couldn't hope to be able to specifically identify the top two or three things that will drive change in technical services.

#### Context

You can't do more with less.  In fact, you probably can't do what you think you're doing now with the resources you think you're allocating to technical services.  (In case it's not absolutely clear, "you" means a public library).  You can only do more with more.

Library workers need to be unionized.  This could help with a number of problems, including vocational awe, precarity [101], and various kinds of bias.

### The Button

There are three threads running through this note:

   * different organizations within the library should work together
   * the quality and ease of service a patron experiences shouldn't depend on whether they interact in person with a librarian; it shouldn't depend on whether they're visiting the building or the web site
   * patrons should be educated in using library resources, specifically the catalog

This last comes down to teaching patrons to fish *in addition to* giving them fish.

More than a tag line, every campaign needs a button.  I suggest two:

   * It takes a Library
   * Together We Can

I like the second a bit better than the first since it brings in the community as well as the library — as long as you remember that different parts of the library should "work together" as well as the library and the community.

## All services are services

I want to be very clear that Non-interactive Services, Technical Services, *are* services.  Let's look at some ways patrons use the library:

* A patron goes to the web site or catalog and borrows e-media;

* A patron goes to the library and borrows an item without interacting with a librarian;

* A patron attends a non-library event at the library;

* A patron sees a tweet or email message or display in the library and adds a new book to their TBR list;

* Based on something a friend says, a patron checks the catalog and discovers a new book by a favorite author.

If you regard non-interactive services as no less than interactive services — and I do — you have to treat non-interactive services as self-sufficient.  "If you have a question, ask a librarian" undercuts that commitment by turning a non-interactive service into an interactive service.  This has obvious implications for, e.g., online documentation or signage.

## How Services Relate to Each Other

Here's a brain dump, or if you're inclined to be charitable, a mind map:

<img src="images\TSmindmap.png" alt="Diagram showing how library programs relate to non-interactive services, including the web site and catalog" height="300" />

I'm going to talk about the elements in the upper left of the diagram before we jump into the deep end of the catalog.

## The Web Site

I hope we can agree that the web site is a service.  We just have to figure how to improve it.

### The Three Silos

One speed bump is that "web site" means two different things.  From the outside, it probably means "the library on the internet", which includes the catalog and calendar; from the inside it probably means "the thing our web site builder builds".  For convenience, I'll use the latter meaning, but that's probably not how patrons think of it.

I'll give a small example of how these silos affect patrons using an imaginary site that combines features from a few different libraries and OPACs.

Because the [Samuels Public Library](https://www.samuelslibrary.net/) [102] only has one location, the web site gives the telephone number and hours right on the front page.  On the other hand, the [Frederick Public Libraries](https://fcpl.org/) has multiple locations, so you have to navigate to a "Branches" page to see the hours of each branch.  Suppose you could tell the FCPL web site which branch was your local branch, so it could display the hours on the front page.

The FCPL calendar allows you to choose which of the eight branches you want to see events for.  Suppose you could tell the calendar which branch was your local branch, so it could display just events for that branch.

Some OPACs allow you to specify a branch where your holds will be delivered.  BiblioCommons also indicates when an item is available at your favorite branch(es).

It would be great if a patron could specify their local branch once and have it apply to all three of these cases.  That this is manifestly impossible just underlines how separate the silos are.  We'll take this limitation as a given, since here we are chasing the possible.

I won't have anything more to say about the calendar since I think it's a lost cause.  I'm going to discuss the web site part of the web site here, and the catalog later.

### Web Site Organization

 I'm going to go through the [FCPL Home Page](https://fcpl.org/) row by row.

* The top row consists of a logo / home page button, a search box, and Help and My Account buttons;

* The second row is a menu bar with four buttons:  Visit, Learn, Download and Participate;

* The third and fourth rows are six images of "What's New At Your Library";

* the fifth row (we're now below the fold) is a hero banner for the Building Bridges resource page.  The banner consists of book cover images;

* the sixth and seventh rows are images for virtual events;

* the seventh row is a menu bar with four buttons:  About, Account, Contact and "❤️ Support";

* the eighth row is a row of icons for social media, such as Facebook and Instagram.

I've described the front page in mind-numbing detail to make the point that even a simple web page like this one has quite a lot of complexity that has to be carefully wrangled.  The challenge in using "soft" categories like "Visit" and "Learn" (as opposed to hard categories like "Branches" or "Digital Media") is that it's not always obvious what goes where.  Actually, I think FCPL has a pretty good set of categories, but let's pick at it a little anyway.

Where does Inter-Library Loan go?  It's under "Visit".  Information about the Bookmobile?  It's under "Visit".  Newsletters?  Ditto.

But it doesn't matter what I think, or how I would re-organize this menu bar.  What matters is how easy the library patrons in Frederick find it — particularly new patrons, or patrons that speak languages other than English.  This is the sort of UX/UI question that you might address using [card sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_sorting).

### Online Documentation

Documentation is just any part of the web site where you're explaining how to do something.  It's not easy;  one reason it's prone to errors is because the writer can miss uncommon cases.
 
For example, on the FCPL web site, the FAQ for "Changing the Pickup location for Holds" seems to be incomplete.  It doesn't seem to apply to patrons who have never put something on hold, such as someone with a new account.

For digita media, like Hoopla, libraries don't really attempt any documentation, just linking to the product's web site and help.  That's unfortunate, in my opinion.

Suppose you have library cards at two different libraries.  How does Hoopla handle that?  How do you find out what to do?  One important clue is that you need separate email addresses for the separate accounts.

What if you move from one state to another?  It turns out that this is "explained" in one of the Hoopla FAQs, if you can find it.  Searching the Hoopla FAQs by "moving" yields nothing useful; you have to search on "moved" or "changing".

I don't want to beat on the Hoopla documentation; there's not a lot of point, but this is too good to miss:  "However, operating systems do not always perfume this task well ..."

Libraries can wish that Hoopla had better documentation — or they can start writing it themselves.

### Landing Pages

In "landing pages" I include true landing pages like [Bulding Bridges](https://fcpl.org/building-bridges) as well as child pages like [Building Bridges - Adult Titles](https://fcpl.org/building-bridges-adult-titles).  Let's look at the latter.

There are 40 books on this page.  It's a pretty good list, but the library probably has hundreds of similar books.  For example, the list includes three cookbooks.  By clicking through to each cookbook and clicking on subject headings, I found 27 African American, 22 African, 35 Chinese and 5 Philippine cookbooks.

Let's suppose we want to help patrons find these 86 extra cookbooks, but maybe they already know what to do.  The first step in helping patrons is always determining whether they need help, and what kind of help.

There are a couple of 

----- START HERE ------

### Accessibility

In *What Can A Body Do?* Sara Hendren makes the point that disability is a function of the built environment.  That is, a person is disabled not as an intrinsic characteristic, but because the built environment has disabled them.  The built environment naturally includes web sites.

#### An Example

Here's the FCPL home page:

<img src="images\FCPLhomepage.jpeg" alt="Image of the FCPL home page" height="300" />

The page has a lot of images.  Some of the images include alt tags and some don't.  Alt tags are needed for screen readers to "read" the image.  By omitting alt tags, this web page has disabled patrons who use screen readers.

Don't do this!  Every image on the web site, or in an email, tweet or post should include an alt tag.

#### Another example

Here's a page from the catalog:

<img src="images\FCPLfakearrows.png" alt="Top part of a catalog page for the book The everything healthy casserole cookbook, with arrows on the left and right of the page, circled" height="200" />

What do those arrows do?  Nothing.

#### So What?

There are two related problems:  people's expectations are set by the best web sites they encounter; and people will avoid a poorly designed web site without necessarily being conscious of why.




### Online Documentation



-- gap --

Suppose you build a landing page for Gay Pride Month on the web site.  (It could be fcpl.org/gaypride, for example.)  What should be on the landing page?

There are lots of examples of landing pages on the current web site.  For example, 

-- lists or searches, that is the question!

***Following is out of place***

BiblioCommons [103] has an interesting feature where you can interpolate other information between results on the search results page.  If someone searches for any of the terms in LGBTQIA+, the search results page could include a pointer to the Gay Pride landing page.  This would be useful year round, and not just for a month.  Of course in this, as in so many other things, you're at the mercy of your OPAC vendor.


## Wayfinding and Signage

Mark Aaron Polger was written a book on signage called *Library Signage and Wayfinding Design* which you can [buy from ALA](https://www.alastore.ala.org/wayfinding).

My general comments on signage, and specific comments on the book, [can be found here](https://github.com/lagbolt/library/blob/main/Polgerbookreview.md).

I've reviewed the wayfinding and signage at a number of branches of the Las Vegas Clark County Library District.  My review [can be found here](https://github.com/lagbolt/library/blob/main/LVCCLD-signage.md)

I'm going to show a couple of examples from the Frederick County Public Libraries system, specifically the central, C. Burr Artz branch.  I'm shpwing these examples because I happened upon them, not because either the branch or the system is deficient in some way.

The shelving upstairs in the library is laid out sensibly, and the signage is clear.  The signs are color-coded:  one color for fiction and one for non-fiction.  And then there's this sign:

<img src="images\ArtzEndcapSign.jpg" alt="Photo of a sign on the end of a library shelf, explained in the text" height="300" />

One side of this shelf holds the beginning (AA-BA) of the fiction section.  The other side of the shelf holds Large Print Biography, Large Print Non-Fiction, and the end (SZ??) of the Large Print Fiction section.

The person who wrote this sign tried to get all this information into a sign that's exactly the same size as all the other signs.  It's too much!

Most of the shelves are perpendicular to the main aisle, so the signs on the ends of the shelves are quite visible.  The Science Fiction shelves are against the wall on the right, parallel to the aisle.  Here's one of the signs for Science Fiction:

<img src="images\ArtzScienceFictionSign.jpg" alt="Photo of a sign on the end of a library shelf, explained in the text" height="300" />

Can you see the sign?  Nor can I.  Let's zoom in:

<img src="images\ArtzScienceFictionZoomed.jpg" alt="Photo of a sign on the end of a library shelf, explained in the text" height="300" />

The problem is that this sign, like all the others, has been placed on the end of the shelf.  There's *almost* nowhere along the central aisle where this sign is readable.

What's missing is a sign at what Polger calls a "bump point".  A place where the patron has to be bumped in the right direction.

## The Catalog

What use is the catalog?

If the catalog HAS value, it will ADD value whenever the collection is relevant to another library activity.  The activity doesn't even need to be book related.  If a local potter is doing a pottery demonstration, the promotional materials could include a QR code to search the catalog for materials on pottery.

### Marketing the Catalog

Let me start off with a *reductio ad absurdum*:  Libraries put a lot of effort into informing patrons about different library services and events, and none into how to use advanced search.  What would it look like if the entire library decided to help people search the catalog?

Suppose a public library is going to celebrate National Crocodile Day.  There will be a display of crocodile books as you enter the library, crocodile puppets in the children's section and a talk about crocodiles by a local author, all of which will be heavily promoted on social media, including in the library email newsletter and on the library's Twitter, Facebook and Instagram feeds.  If the OPAC supports it, a librarian will create a list of crocodile books which will also appear in the library's social media feeds.

The problem is this barely touches the collection and the catalog at all.  How should technical services be involved in National Crocodile Day?

If a librarian tweets a book recommendation, why doesn't that tweet include a link to the catalog?  If a librarian goes to the trouble of compiling a list of 10 or 20 crocodile books, why doesn't that list end with a canned OPAC search for more crocodile books or movies.

Let's abandon crocodiles and see what we can do during  Gay Pride Month (which happens to be June).

#### Social Media

A tweet or FB post could explain how to do Boolean searches, using as an example a search on ...

#### Readers Advisory

-- reference desk would display searches
-- marketing materials would include sample searches

-- in-library displays would include searches or a QR code

### Searching the catalog

-- the web site would pop-up links to tutorials

Some libraries have implemented a search page that is separate from the catalog and sits in front of it.

For example, the [Tulsa City-County Library](https://www.tulsalibrary.org/) has a search box on their front page which returns results on a custom results page.  It's easier to see than it is to describe, so click on the link and search for "computer".  You'll see results from the catalog, the web site, and the events calendar.  You can get to the full catalog by clicking on "SEE ALL RESULTS IN CATALOG", or you can do another search in this simplified environment.

Although Tulsa Library doesn't do it, the custom search results page could include links to help on searching.

It's obviously some work to implement custom searching with a custom results page, but the advantage is that you've escaped the limitations of your OPAC.

### Enhancing the Catalog

Almost anything you do in this area, other than paying a third party to do it, is going to involve a combination of automatic and manual checking.  There is no magic bullet.

One reason to be concerned with the catalog is that errors and omissions in the catalog mean that patrons will see incorrect results from a search.

In 2005, Jeffrey Beall wrote a column for the ALA's American Libraries magazine giving "Ten Ways to Improve Data Quality" [104].  The reason I'm mentioning this here is that his tenth point was that everyone in the library should be involved in finding catalog errors.  This is part of what elevates catalog quality from a sticky note to a part of strategy.

#### Catalog Quality

I've written about catalog quality for Technicalities [105].  That article has several interesting examples of data I've collected from the LVCCLD (Las Vegas) catalog.

I'm interested in three different, separate standards for catalog quality:

1. Assessing catalog records against a standard, either internal or external
2. Effectiveness in supporting library programs
3. Effectiveness in supporting the community

#### Is this a big problem?

Well, that's a good place to start!  How many of your catalog records have errors?  If you wanted to know what percentage of your patrons were taller than 6', you take a random sample and measure them.  It's the same with catalog records.  You need to take a random sample of, say, 100 records and check them.

I've done this once [ibid].  The most common "error" was missing series information, which I put in quotes since it's not clear that series information — however useful it is for patrons — is required by any cataloging standard.

I also have plenty of anecdotal data to suggest that in public libraries authority control of names and subject headings isn't very good.  Errors in authority control translate directly into patron-visible errors.  For example, in the FCPL catalog there are 8 books and a DVD with a subject heading of "supsense".  Those items simply won't appear in a search for "suspense".

[Typos like this aren't actually very common.  I collected data for a handful of typos from 100+ public libraries in the US and for any given typo the median number of times it occurred was zero.]

Most technical errors, such as "A is for Activist" with an incorrect 245 second indicator, have no visibility in the OPAC and no effect on patrons.

My strong recommendation is that you check a random sample of records so you have some idea what your error rate is, and that you check your authority control against the original thesauri (e.g., the Library of Congress) on a regular basis.

#### Supporting Library Programs

Suppose the library is celebrating El día de los niños / El día de los libros (on April 30).

So what, what, what??


#### Supporting a Diverse Community

There are two problems with Lesbian Visibility Day (April 26).  First, lesbian visibility shouldn't be limited to a single day.  Second, it shouldn't be limited to lesbians.  As the [University of Wisconsin Platteville says](https://www.uwplatt.edu/events/2022/04/lesbian-visibility-day), "It is essential that Lesbian Visibility Week is a voice for unity and lifts up ALL women, especially those who come from marginalized communities."

Lesbians should always be able to find themselves represented at the library, on the web site and in the catalog.  Let's take a look at the catalog.  One of the things I like to do is to compare the results of a keyword (i.e., anywhere) search with a subject heading search.

A keyword search on "lesbian fiction" (no quotes throughout) returned 244 items; a subject heading search returned 6 items.  What's going on?

It turns out the the correct subject heading isn't "Lesbian Fiction", it's "Lesbians--Fiction" with an 's'.  Given that the OPAC will punish errors rather than helping, isn't it the patron's responsibilty to know the Library of Congress subject headings?  After all, there's only 400,000 of them.

The problem is those six hits.  If you look at one of those six books, "Lesbian -- Fiction" will appear as one of the subject headings.  You can click on it and get back to the list of six books.  It *looks* as though you've done the right thing.

Here's another example.  A subject heading search on "bisexuality" returns 30 items, "bisexual" returns 18, and "bisexuals" returns 16.  And there are 54 *more* items returned by a keyword search for "bisexual".  I'll leave it to the reader to draw a [Venn Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram).

And now this:

<img src="images\FCPLnottheonlyfruit.png" alt="Screenshot of part of a MARC record, including 650 7 $a LGBTQIA+ (Fiction) $2 Overdrive" height="100" />

This is disastrous!  Overdrive have invented their own subject heading, "LGBTQIA+ (Fiction)"; there are 338 items (ebooks and audiobooks) that use this heading.  First, these items will be invisible to a search using the "official" subject headings.  Second, if you're looking at one of these items, you'll see this subject heading and can click on it, but what will be returned will be these 338 items.  You might possibly conclude that FCPL has no books [5] of LGBTQIA+ Fiction.

To be completely clear, there's nothing wrong with subject headings from a thesaurus other than LCSH.  It's not even so bad that Overdrive has made up their own code for the $2 subfield, although it's technically incorrect [7].
The problem is that the "LGBTQIA+ (Fiction)" is only included in some of the items it applies to, with the result that search results will be incomplete.

##### But

Couldn't a patron just ask at the reference desk?  There are a couple of answers to that, starting with, "Hell, No!!".

Are you sure that the reference librarian understands enough about boolean searching to work through all the possibilities in that Venn Diagram?  How much training have they had on your catalog?

Assuming the patron is comfortable discussing sexuality with the reference librarian at all, what do you want the response to be:

* "Here's a list of books"
* "Here's how I used the catalog to search for these books"

or both, of course.  If a reference librarian can't help patrons learn about searching the catalog, who can?

+++++++

##### Now Read This

Read [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/JewWhoHasItAll/status/1519674135428964353?s=20&t=i9g8YoR8lgLdfcB5twgH3g).

This happens to be about Christianity and Judaism, but I hope you can see that this criticism applies to any attempt to package someone else's culture.  Tread carefully!

+++++++

##### Offensive Subject Headings

For example, a search of the FCPL catalog returns 675 items with the subject heading "Indians of North America".

OCLC has just issued a report on this topic, *Reimagine Descriptive Workflows* [99].  It's worth reading the whole thing, but I want to pull a few sentences out of the report.

The report clearly advocates adding subject headings from alternative (i.e., non-LCSH) controlled vocabularies.  It gives an example of a record from the State Library of New South Wales which includes First Nations subject headings [99, p21].

Talking about the tension between local variation and network standardization, the report states, "It is likely that future systems will need to accommodate elements
of both." [99, p13].  To me, this is a  rejection of Library of Congress control in reaction to the time taken to respond to the "illegal aliens" heading.  Something other than, or in addition to, the Library of Congress change process is clearly needed.

The question of power and control is central to any discussion of alternative subject headings, and the OCLC report spends a significant fraction of the report considering it.  As a patron and not a librarian, I'm comfortable with the idea that patrons could select subject headings, but I understand that professional librarians might not be so sanguine.

Homosaurus

Most of the people who developed the homosaurus are professional librarians.

https://homosaurus.org/about

##### My OPAC is better than your OPAC

In reviewing the FCPL catalog, I noticed a couple of things that the FCPL (TCL) OPAC can't do that the Las Vegas (Bibliocommons) OPAC can.  (Of course, the opposite is also true.)

FCPL doesn't have a full query language, so a patron can't write queries like "(crocodile OR alligator) AND smile".  A patron also can't build a query which will return the whole catalog, which makes it hard (or impossible?) to do a facet-only search like "show me all the Large Print books newest first".

A more significant issue is that there is no way to search for bilingual material [6].  There is a language facet, but you can only choose one language at a time, and it uses the MARC 008 leader field, which can only specify a single language.

You can try using subject headings: "spanish language materials -- bilingual" returns 220 results, but that doesn't seem to be complete, since a keyword search on "spanish bilingual" returns 284 items.

It does no good to plead, bribe or threaten your current OPAC vendor.  What's needed, as [Emily Drabinski](https://www.emilydrabinski.com/) would say, is collective power.

I can see this collective power coming either from libraries or librarians.

The most power a library has is when it issues an RFP.  The functions needed for complete, correct and culturally appropriate cataloging, classification and search need to be wired into the RFP.  One mechanism for drafting RFP clauses is for the state to take the lead.

For librarians, the obvious mechanism is the ALA.  I'd love to see librarians name and shame both libraries and vendors.  What would it mean for an ALA committee to give each public library a letter grade for their cataloging?

[104] Beall, Jeffrey, 10 Ways to Improve Data Quality, American Libraries, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Mar., 2005), pp. 36-37

Here's the tenth entry:  "**Involve all library staff in database maintenance.**  Have staffers report errors to a central person, preferably someone in the cataloging department.  Many library staff make extensive use of the library catalog and are in a position to observe errors.  Take advantage of their catalog use and ask them to report the errors they find.

"Library catalogs should be tools for research; we must not allow them to become barriers to retrieval.  Libraries are obligated to to make services as error-free as possible.  A coordinated effort to eliminate errors in online catalogs demonstrates a strong commitment to quality service.  The reward of this work will be better access to library materials for our patrons."
