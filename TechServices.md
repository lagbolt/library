## Technical Services:  The Next Three Years

This is my input to:

   * The Frederick County Public Libraries (FCPL) 2023-2025 Three Year Plan, and
   * An effort in an unnamed Virginia public library to "update and reinvigorate Technical Services"

It's a coincidence that these two things happened to drop at the same time.  I'm able to address then both at the same time because my interest and focus in public libraries is in Technical Services.  To be honest, I'm not sure what is Technical Services and what is not.  I'll be looking at:

   * the online catalog
   * the web site
   * wayfinding and signage

When I need to refer to these three things in a bucket, I'll call the bucket "Non-interactive services", meaning services that don't entail interacting in person with a librarian.

#### The Disclaimer

What follows is just what I've been thinking about lately.  I couldn't hope to be able to specifically identify the top two or three things that will drive change in technical services.

#### Context

You can't do more with less.  In fact, you probably can't do what you think you're doing with the resources you think you're allocating to technical services.  (In case it's not absolutely clear, "you" means a public library).  You can only do more with more.

Library workers need to be unionized.  This could help with a number of problems, including vocational awe, precarity, and various kinds of bias.

### The Button

There are three threads running through this note:

   * different organizations within the library should work together
   * the quality and ease of service a patron experiences shouldn't depend on whether they interact in person with a librarian
   * patrons should be educated in using library resources

This last comes down to teaching patrons to fish *in addition to* giving them fish.

More than a tag line, every campaign needs a button.  I suggest two:

   * It takes a Library
   * Together We Can

I like the second a bit better than the first since it brings in the community as well as the library — as long as you remember that different parts of the library should "work together" as well as the library and the community.

## All services are services

I want to be very clear that Non-interactive Service, Technical Services, *are* services.  Let's look at some ways patrons use library services:

* A patron goes to the web site or catalog and borrows e-media;

* A patron goes to the library and borrows an item without interacting with a librarian;

* A patron attends a non-library event at the library;

* A patron sees a tweet or email message or display in the library and adds a new book to their TBR list;

* Based on something a friend says, a patron checks the catalog and discovers a new book by a favorite author.

If you regard non-interactive services as no less than interactive services — and I do — you have to treat non-interactive services as self-sufficient.  "If you have a question, ask a librarian" undercuts that commitment by turning a non-interactive service into an interactive service.  This has obvious implications for, e.g., signage.

## How Services Relate to Each Other

Here's a brain dump, or a mind map if you're inclined to be charitable:

<img src="images\TS-Mindmap.jpg" alt="Diagram showing how library programs relate to non-interactive services, including the web site and catalog" height="300" />

If the catalog HAS value, it will ADD value whenever the collection is relevant to another library activity.  The activity doesn't even need to be book related.  If a local potter is doing a pottery demonstration, the promotional materials could include a QR code to search the catalog for materials on pottery.

#### A Silly Example

Suppose a public library is going to celebrate National Crocodile Day.  There will be a display of crocodile books as you enter the library, crocodile puppets in the children's section and a talk about crocodiles by a local author, all of which will be heavily promoted on social media, including in the library email newsletter and on the library's Twitter, Facebook and Instagram feeds.  If the OPAC supports it, a librarian will create a list of crocodile books which will also appear in the library's social media feeds.

The problem is this barely touches the collection and the catalog at all.  How should technical services be involved in National Crocodile Day?

If a librarian tweets a book recommendation, why doesn't that tweet include a link to the catalog?  If a librarian goes to the trouble of compiling a list of 10 or 20 crocodile books, why doesn't that list end with a canned OPAC search for more crocodile books or movies.

Let's abandon crocodiles and see what we can do during  Gay Pride Month (which happens to be June).

#### Landing Pages & Readers Advisory

In "landing pages" I include true landing pages like [Bulding Bridges](https://fcpl.org/building-bridges) as well as child pages like [Building Bridges Adult Titles](https://fcpl.org/building-bridges-adult-titles).  Let's look at the latter.

There are 40 books on this page.  It's a pretty good list, but the library probably has thousands of similar books.  For example, the list includes three cookbooks.  By clicking to each cookbook and clicking on subject headings, I found 27 African American, 22 African, 35 Chinese and 5 Philippine cookbooks.

That operation — clicking on a book then clicking on its subject headings — is something that any patron should be comfortable with.



-- gap --

Suppose you build a landing page for Gay Pride Month on the web site.  (It could be fcpl.org/gaypride, for example.)  What should be on the landing page?

There are lots of examples of landing pages on the current web site.  For example, 

-- lists or searches, that is the question!


BiblioCommons has an interesting feature where you can interpolate other information between results on the search results page.  If someone searches for any of the terms in LGBTQIA+, the search results page could include a pointer to the Gay Pride landing page.  This would be useful year round, and not just for a month.  Of course in this, as in so many other things, you're at the mercy of your OPAC vendor.



## Other Services Adding Value to Technical Services

Let me start off with a *reductio ad absurdum*:  Libraries put a lot of effort into informing patrons about different library services and events, and none into how to use advanced search.  What would it look like if the entire library decided to help people search the catalog?

-- reference desk would display searches
-- marketing materials would include sample searches

-- in-library displays would include searches or a QR code

## Improvements within Technical Services



### The Organization of the Web Site


### Wayfinding and Signage

Mark Aaron Polger was written a book on signage called *Library Signage and Wayfinding Design* which you can [buy from ALA](https://www.alastore.ala.org/wayfinding).

My general comments on signage, and specific comments on the book, [can be found here](https://github.com/lagbolt/library/blob/main/Polgerbookreview.md).

I've reviewed the wayfinding and signage at a number of branches of the Las Vegas Clark County Library District.  My review [can be found here](https://github.com/lagbolt/library/blob/main/LVCCLD-signage.md)

I'm going to show a couple of examples from the Frederick County Public Libraries system, specifically the central, C. Burr Artz branch.  I'm shpwing these examples because I happened upon them, not because either the branch or the system is deficient in some way.

The shelving upstairs in the library is laid out sensibly, and the signage is clear.  The signs are color-coded:  one color for fiction and one for non-fiction.  And then there's this sign:

<img src="images\ArtzEndcapSign.jpg" alt="Photo of a sign on the end of a library shelf, explained in the text" height="300" />

One side of this shelf holds the beginning (AA-BA) of the fiction section.  The other side of the shelf holds Large Print Biography, Large Print Non-Fiction, and the end (SZ??) of the Large Print Fiction section.

The person who wrote this sign tried to get all this information into a sign that's exactly the same size as all the other signs.  It's too much!

Most of the shelves are perpendicular to the main aisle, so the signs on the ends of the shelves are quite visible.  The Science Fiction shelves are against the wall on the right, parallel to the aisle.  Here's one of the signs for Science Fiction:

<img src="images\ArtzScienceFictionSign.jpg" alt="Photo of a sign on the end of a library shelf, explained in the text" height="300" />

Can you see the sign?  Nor can I.  Let's zoom in:

<img src="images\ArtzScienceFictionZoomed.jpg" alt="Photo of a sign on the end of a library shelf, explained in the text" height="300" />

The problem is that this sign, like all the others, has been placed on the end of the shelf.  There's *almost* nowhere along the central aisle where this sign is readable.

What's missing is a sign at what Polger calls a "bump point".  A place where the patron has to be bumped in the right direction.

### Searching the catalog

-- the web site would pop-up links to tutorials

Some libraries have implemented a search page that is separate from the catalog and sits in front of it.

For example, the [Tulsa City-County Library](https://www.tulsalibrary.org/) has a search box on their front page which returns results on a custom results page.  It's easier to see than it is to describe, so click on the link and search for "computer".  You'll see results from the catalog, the web site, and the events calendar.  You can get to the full catalog by clicking on "SEE ALL RESULTS IN CATALOG", or you can do another search in this simplified environment.

Although Tulsa Library doesn't do it, the custom search results page could include links to help on searching.

It's obviously some work to implement custom searching with a custom results page, but the advantage is that you've escaped the limitations of your OPAC.

### Enhancing the Catalog

Almost anything you do in this area, other than paying a third party to do it, is going to involve a combination of automatic and manual checking.  There is no magic bullet.

#### Errors and Omissions

One reason to be concerned with the catalog is that errors and omissions in the catalog mean that patrons will see incorrect results from a search.

In 2005, Jeffrey Beall wrote a column for the ALA's American Libraries magazine giving "Ten Ways to Improve Data Quality" [1].  The reason I'm mentioning this here is that his tenth point was that everyone in the library should be involved in finding catalog errors.  This is part of what elevates catalog quality from a sticky note to a part of strategy.

##### Is this a big problem?

Well, that's a good place to start!  How many of your catalog records have errors?

I've done some exploration of this question with the Las Vegas catalog (at https://lvccld.bibliocommons.com/) [2]



#### Quality Control

I can think of two ways of doing quality control of the catalog data, and one that doesn't work very well.

The one that doesn't work very well is to check catalog records for internal consistency.  For example, you could check that if a catalog record has an 830 field, it also has a 490 field.  The problem is, this sort of technical error won't make any difference to patrons (although I suppose this example depends on how you have your OPAC configured) and errors that do make a difference won't be picked up by this sort of check.

One way that works pretty well — one I've used a few times in a couple of different ways — is to check catalog records against an external reference.
 * subjects and names against the LoC authority files
 * series information (or the lack of it) against GoodReads
 [Note:  Goodreads series data is far more complete than Novelist, and I have the data to prove it.]

 #### Typos

Any typo can potentially affect keyword searching, but typos in subject headings are particularly bad, since the result is that an item disappears from search results.

For example, there are 8 books and a DVD with a subject heading of "supsense" in the FCPL catalog.

Typos aren't actually very common.  I collected data for a handful of typos from 100+ public libraries in the US and for any given typo the median number of times it occurred was zero.

#### Offensive Subject Headings

For example, a search of the FCPL catalog returns 675 items with the subject heading "Indians of North America".



 Another possibility, which I'd describe as more of a research project because I haven't tried it yet, is to look at your search logs and check the results.  The advantage of this approach is that it fixes what is actually relevant to patrons.

Just a reminder that all FCPL locations will be closed tomorrow, Sunday, April 17, in observance of Easter.

I just can't express how angry this makes me.

V. E. Schwab has two NARs.  Andrea Stewart has one but it's not the LoC value.

## Notes

[1] Beall, Jeffrey, 10 Ways to Improve Data Quality, American Libraries, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Mar., 2005), pp. 36-37

Here's the tenth entry:  "**Involve all library staff in database maintenance.**  Have staffers report errors to a central person, preferably someone in the cataloging department.  Many library staff make extensive use of the library catalog and are in a position to observe errors.  Take advantage of their catalog use and ask them to report the errors they find.

"Library catalogs should be tools for research; we must not allow them to become barriers to retrieval.  Libraries are obligated to to make services as error-free as possible.  A coordinated effort to eliminate errors in online catalogs demonstrates a strong commitment to quality service.  The reward of this work will be better access to library materials for our patrons."

Something Einstein didn't say:  Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
